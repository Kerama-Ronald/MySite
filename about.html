    <p> “Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. 
        The important thing is not to stop questioning.” 
        <br>
        “He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead;
        <br>
         his eyes are closed.” “A happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.
        <br>
